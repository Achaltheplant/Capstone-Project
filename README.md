The solution proposed is to utilise an interactive test which is cost-effective screening compared to imaging tests and if a positive is found, the patient can be forwarded to specialists which in turn, is a scalable solution for hospitals and telemedicine platforms

This is a Prediction problem and the dataset was sourced from Kaggle "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rabieelkharoua/alzheimers-disease-dataset"
